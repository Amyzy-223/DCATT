The code for the DCATT (diffusion convolutional attention model), a novel spatial-temporal model to provide multistep predictions of operators' abnormal cognitive state under heat stress. DCATT effectively utilizes spatiotemporal information in fNIRS dynamic graphs and ECG time-frequency features extracted via neuroscience analysis. The model captures spatial dependencies via diffusion graph convolution to simulate dynamic brain networks, enhancing short-term forecasting. It further models temporal relationships by a multi-head self-attention mechanism to aggregate historical information, improving long-term prediction. Eventually, a multi-head cross-attention mechanism with position encoding is applied to physiological embeddings to generate latent future cognitive representations.
